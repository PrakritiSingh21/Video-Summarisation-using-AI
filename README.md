# Video-Summarisation-using-AI

Video Summarisation is basically the technique to make a short preview of a longer video. This technique is used in our daily lives and in our surroundings more often than we can imagine. Using q- learning technique, through this project we have hoped to achieve a short preview of our own test video via the website we have made.
Our project is directed more towards a safety purpose usage of the 
application. We are focused on making the previews of day and
hour long surveillance camera footage.
